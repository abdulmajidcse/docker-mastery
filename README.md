## Lesson 01: Docker Fundamentals — From Zero to First Setup

In this lesson, I explain Docker from the ground up so that new and aspiring developers can understand Docker concepts clearly and confidently.

This lesson focuses on building a strong foundation by covering both core concepts and practical setup, making Docker easy to understand even for absolute beginners.
